## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide weather-based analysis of historic temperatures for June and Dec. 

## Results
Please refer to the side-by-side image for [June and Dec data here](stats_compared.png).
1) June and December temperatures in Hawaii are actually pretty close (compared to those in Toronto for example)
2) June weather is typically warmer by about 4F
3) The standard deviation for June is lower than December
- June temperatures range from 64F - 85F (about 21F range)
- December temperatures range from 56F - 83 (about a 27F range)

## Summary
In summary, Hawaii would likely be a great place to set up an ice cream & surf shop as there is low precipitation and warm weather. 
In addition to looking at temperature and precipitation, we may also want to look at:
1) Sunshine vs cloudiness
- While precipitation is low in general, we may want to analysis how cloudy days may effect our client base. 
- We will likely get more customers on sunny days
2) Wind conditions
- Since wind helps make waves, we'd want to set up our surf shop somewhere where we would have some good waves to surf on!
